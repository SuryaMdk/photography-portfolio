Hi... I'm a hobby photographer.
A little story about me
When I was in school, I was introduced to photography by a TV show called Natgeo Cover Shots on National Geographic Channel.Since then I became more interested in it. After that I bought a mobile phone in 2017 when I was studying in college. Since then I started taking a lot of photographs.
I have added some of my favorite photos from my collection to this portfolio.
Now I am learning a lot about photography.
I am going to buy a camera soon so that I can improve the quality of my photos and take my photography skills to the next level.
