			<h1>A little story about me</h1>
			<p>Hey there! Back in school, I discovered my love for photography thanks to a show called Natgeo Cover Shots on the National Geographic Channel. That sparked my interest, and in 2017, while I was in college, I got my first mobile phone. That's when my photo-taking journey began.</p>
			<p>I've included some of my favorite shots from my collection in this portfolio. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of photography, learning and growing every day. Exciting times ahead!</p>
			
				<p>Thank you!</p>
